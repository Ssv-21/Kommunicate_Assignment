Describe the best project you have worked on, including links if any?

In my B.tech we a group of enthusiasts worked on the concept of Online/Digital Library Management i.e and named it as Bibliophile's corner. 
Which has been designed to computerize and automate the information which is digitalised and stored in the form of electronic portal that provides access to 
all kind of database such as bibliographies, full-text resources, catalogues, search engines, internet resources, reference works, E-journals 
and along with the audiobooks etc. Earlier its only paper based works only available in libraries.
