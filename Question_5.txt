If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you will choose as your partner and why?

If I were to start a software company, I would consider hiring Krupa Nanda, who is a dedicated tech enthusiast who always tries to innovate things,
and Revanth Babu, who is good at coming up with new ideas. These two will cover the areas where I am lacking.
